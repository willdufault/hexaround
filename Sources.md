# Sources


The code should be your own, almost exclusively, unless you 
extract a small snippet from a source. If you write code for 
an algorithm that you searched for, cite the page or book that 
you found it in your code as a comment. If you use a generative 
AI that writes, or produces example code, copy the whole session, 
or a shared link to the session in this file.
